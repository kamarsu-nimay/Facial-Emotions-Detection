# Facial-Emotions-Detection

## Getting Started
1. install the required python libraries in the system seperately.
* ```
  pip install deepface
  ```
* ```
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
* ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
* ```
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
2. Clone the repo into the system:
   ```
   https://github.com/nimay-kamarsu/Facial-Emotions-Detection.git
   ```

## System Design
* This program is designed to detect the emotions in a face.
* A machine learning library "DeepFace" is used to build the program.
* "Deepface" is a pre-trained model which has been trained on large datasets for facial emotion recognition.
* The program takes the input from the user to choose either a live webcam or an image on the device for facial emotion detection.
